# IOSpeedTest
Purpose:
Determine the optimal low-level I/O speed to transfer large amounts of data

This is the revision work based on my recent publication "Practical Tera-scale Walsh-Hadamard Transform", Future Technologies Conference - FTC 2016, IEEE, pp. 1230-1236, 2017. I spent around 5-6 months scattered in two years (between 2015 and 2016) working with big headaches on the coding/paper. Though massive amounts of various debugging/trouble-shooting efforts were spent, most of the codes are not ready for distribution purpose. As I realize that the out-of-core computing becomes pervasive nowadays, it is a good opportunity to revise them for free distribution within research communities.
